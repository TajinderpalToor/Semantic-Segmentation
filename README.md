## Image Segmentation of Objects in an Unstructured Environment for Autonomous Driving Systems

## Abstract
The field of Autonomous vehicle systems has been
rapidly growing over the years. A good Autonomous vehicle
system should be able to adapt and process any environment
accurately. Unstructured Road Environments are commonly seen
around the world in developing countries and tend to have
numerous objects on the road or in a vehicleâ€™s view. Therefore
Autonomous Vehicles Systems must train on unstructured data
and learn how to partition these objects into different classes or
image segments. Based on the Literature Review of the field it was
found that this is an image segmentation problem. Furthermore,
research has shown that using a U-Net architecture to identify
and segment objects in an unstructured environment can be
done with high accuracy. The U-Net architecture was able to
identify segments within images and perform a pixel by pixel
classification.
